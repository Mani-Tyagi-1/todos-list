Hello coders !!
This is the Todos list created by me. I have created a todo list earlier also but it was made by using HTML, CSS and Js only and this Todos list is created by using react-js.
Although it was a very simple application I didin't focus much on styling this application as its main purpose is to learn react-js

**Functions of the Application: **
1. My Todos List logo and home will take you to the home page where you can use the actual functionality of the application
2. About link will take you to another page where you can read about the app
3. You can add title and description of your task
4. Your task will remain same after refreshing the page
5. You can delete those task which you have completed
6. You can't add a empty task

These are some of the basic functinality that I have used in this application. Basically it uses local storage to store your tasks which can be seen even after reloading the page and litle bit of routing knowledge to direct you from one page to another without reloading and that is the main purpose of using react-js to build application.

It is just a basic website but if you want to make any changes or updation **You are most welcome**
